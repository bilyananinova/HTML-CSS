       <article>
            <p> Eight years ago we set out to create a series of awards that were unique. We wanted to impartially identify the very best in the game,judged by experts who could draw on real-life experiences to inform their vote. They had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion for travel and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other industry awards, ours are entirely nominated and voted on by Food and Travel readers.</p>
            <p>So rack your brains and give credit where it’s due by submitting your nomination by logging in using the button on the top right of the page.Maybe it was an undiscovered gourmet bolthole that wowed at the weekend; a restaurant that served a memorable meal; a hotel that provided the perfect stay or perhaps a cruise line that went the extra (nautical) mile. Whatever has impressed you over the past 12 months, we want to hear about it.</p>
            <p>The shortlist will be revealed in the July issue of Food and Travel.Click <a href="https://foodandtravel.com/subscribe">here</a> to be one of the first to find out whose made the shortlist by getting the latest issue delivered straight to your door.
